  [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/home) is a sandbox MMORPG developed by **Sandbox Interactive GmbH** in Berlin. It's key features are **full-loot PvP**, a fully **player-driven economy** and a **true cross-plattform** experience. Game development started in 2012 and was first released in July 2017. When I joined the studio in March 2019, the 16. update "Percival" was about to be released and the game went **free-to-play**. Since then the team has grown from 35 to 105 professionals, including 5 juniors and veterans that I hired.

What I achieved during my {{ page.date|yearsSince }} {{'year'|pluralize(page.date|yearsSince) }} working on Albion Online:
- built up a web infrastructure **team from 2 to 6 developers**
- contributed to 3 major launches, helping to grow **DAU from 12,000 to 358,000**
- contributed to **7 game updates**, delivering 9 main game menus (4 as developer, 5 as UI lead)

Because Albion Online is self-published, Sandbox Interactive runs both a full game-production arm and an in-house publishing division. I’ve contributed to both sides - {{ '2022-11-01'|duration }} on the in-game [**User Interface**](/project/albion-online/albion-ui) team and nearly 4 years with my [**Web (Infrastructure)**](/project/albion-online/albion-web) team.
