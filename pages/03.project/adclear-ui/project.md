For nearly 4 years I have been **Lead Front End Developer** at [AdClear](https://www.adclear.de/). In this position I developed, implemented and managed three major versions of the companies data dashboard, called 'AdClear UI'. The latest re-design is documented on the right.

'AdClear UI' is the main access points for company clients to check their online marketing performance and customer journey analysis.
