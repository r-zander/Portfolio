I joined [AdClear](https://www.adclear.de/) as **Junior Front End Developer** and within 4 years worked my way up to *
*Lead Front End Developer**. In this time I developed, implemented and managed three major versions of the companies
data dashboard, called 'AdClear UI'. The latest re-design is documented on the right.

'AdClear UI' is the main access points for company clients to check their online marketing performance and customer journey analysis.
