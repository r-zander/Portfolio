## <small>Feb 2024</small> - UI Lead <small>({{ '2024-02-01'|duration }})</small>

As UI Lead I ensured the timely delivery of user interfaces for 4 major updates.
The projects I directly owned are:
- Update [#28 "Rogue Frontier"](https://albiononline.com/update/rogue-frontier) (Released 03 Feb 2025)
  - **Bank Overview:** A menu where players can check the contents of their most used item storages from anywhere in the game.
- Update [#27 "Horizons"](https://albiononline.com/update/horizons) (Released 28 Oct 2024)
  - **Quick Presets:** An extension to our settings menu, allowing players to name, share and quickly switch between game configurations. Together with the HUD Editor released in the same update, this was an incredible jump in customization options for the players.
  - **Item Management QoL:** A collection of additions to the inventory and item storage interfaces, to address players longer standing wants.
- Update [#26 "Paths to Glory"](https://albiononline.com/update/paths-to-glory) (Released 22 July 2024)
  - **Albion Journal:** An engaging achievement and guiding menu for players, sorted into categories and sub-categories. Over the next 3 updates more categories where added, but the menu was released in this update.
  - **Party Ready Check:** Not the biggest feature, but again something players wished to see since quite some time. The challenge was to make it useful, not annoying yet not easily missable and not interrupting to players gameplay.
- Update [#25 "Foundations"](https://albiononline.com/update/foundations) (Released 15 April 2024)
  - As I took over in the middle of production, I didn't really own any UI features, but helped smoothly delivering the **Fortifications** menus and balance workload with the parallel [launch of the Europe server](../albion-web).

For highlights, see the summary of Albion dev talks discussing my supervised menus.

## <small>Jun 2020</small> - Web Lead <small>(3 years, 8 months)</small>

To progress in my career I wanted to take up more responsibility. Within the 5 people UI team there was no additional leadership necessary, so I followed an offer from the CEO to get the new Web team up and running, before I return to game team at some point.

See [Albion Publishing](../albion-web) for my achievements and experiences on the publishing unit of Albion Online.

## <small>Mar 2019</small> - UI Developer <small>(1 year, 3 months)</small>

When I joined Sandbox Interactive there was no acting UI Developer, thus I was instructed by the Senior Game Engineers and was responsible for implementing all user interface needs until a second UI Developer joined.
Relevant menus implemented:

- Update [#18 "Rise of Avalon"](https://albiononline.com/update/rise-of-avalon) (Released 12 Aug 2020)
  - **In-Match Scoreboard:** To display players stats (kills/deaths/assists/damage/heals) during and after instanced PvP arena matches.
  - **Building UI:** Was reworked to use our latest UI style and incorporate lots of QoL changes, like displaying the available products.
- Update [#17 "Queen"](https://albiononline.com/update/Queen) (Released 20 Jan 2020)
  - **Hideouts UI:** A menu to manage all aspects of a special, placeable territory, called "Hideouts". Special challenge: Depending on timings and player interactions, this menu supports up to 8 completely different states.
- Update [#16 "Percival"](https://albiononline.com/update/Percival) (Released 10 Jul 2019)
  - **Appearance UI:** Allows players to change all aspects of their characters appearance and is the main HUB to manage and acquire cosmetics for Albion.
  - **Mail UI:** Re-implementation of the message hub of Albion. Allows players to send offline messages to each other, but more importantly it serves as notification center for game feedback, e.g. fulfilled marketplace orders or real estate actions. Special challenge: Guilds also use this menu to manage applications and have a shared inbox.
