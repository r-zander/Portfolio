An animation showing how a comic-style picture can be transformed into an abstract animation by very simple means.

Inspiration taken from this image, found in the internet (author unfortunately unknown):
![Abstract Rare Pepe (Original)](abstract-rare-pepe-original.jpg)

Which again is based on the [meme 'Pepe the Frog'](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-the-frog).
