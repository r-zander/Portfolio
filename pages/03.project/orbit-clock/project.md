The task was to create some kind of abstract time visualization.

My first thought was that the time of the day repeats itself over and over again, every day. So I choose a [lemniscate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate#Lemniscate_of_Bernoulli) as base shape to display the hours of the day.

Then every other unit of time would be shown as an orbit (thus the name <cite>orbit clock</cite>), centered at the position of the next higher unit.
