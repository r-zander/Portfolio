Classic competitive Pong game. Either player using keyboard versus player using mouse or player versus computer, scalable on nine levels (defining the amount of game area that is tracked by the computer player).

In the demo, the computer player is enabled by default. Two play against each other, disable the AI via &lt;A&gt;.

Music recommendation: [Eisenfunk - Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNAdtkSjSps)
