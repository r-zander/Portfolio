In **Progress Station** you are the commander of a space station traveling through the vastness of space.

You configure modules, level up operations, grow your crew and explore space in a quirky and light-hearted science
fantasy setting.

But be careful: bound to you by a sinister curse, an ultra powerful alien entity, known to some as The Destroyer, is
ever looking for you.

If you like the world building of _Adventure Time_ or the epic space saga of _Gloryhammer_ you will feel right at home.

### Features

- A total of 83 game elements wait for you to level them to the maximum
    - 6 modules containing 10 components with 34 operations
    - 10 factions allowing for 120 battles
    - 4 sectors with 13 points of interest
- A boss battle leading into unlockable Galactic Secrets and a roguelite gameplay
- Adaptive UI

### How To Play

- Click progress bars to activate elements and let them level up
- Manage the gained attributes to improve your progress speed
- Ramp up far enough to be able to defeat the galactic boss
- Or start a new playthrough with increased progress speed based on your previous levels

### Technology

The game is set up without any kind of pre-processors, builders or frameworks. Just vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.

The goal was to make development setup as easy as possible even for non-technical team members and to see how far web
technologies have come in 2023/24.
