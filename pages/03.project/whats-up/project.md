Head truth, freedom and some cats: A colorful journey through moving mindscapes. Meet some memes and take a breath of doublethink.

An hommage to the 90s **net art**, this one-page has it all: annoying music, overloaded animations, endless references, copyright infringements. 

A fun experience while being a usability nightmare.
